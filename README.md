This folder holds a small sample CCE deployment on T Cloud Public.

It assumes connectivity to an On Prem network via a VPN.  The On
Prem network host an IdP based on authentik and client systems.

Folders

* 1-infra \
  Deploys infrastructure through Open Tofu.  Used to deploy all
  native T Cloud Public resources.
* 2-shared \
  Deploys / configure Kubernetes infrastructure that is used to host
  the workloads.  Functionality like grafana reporting and http to
  https redirectors are deployed from here.  Deployment is done via
  Helm Charts and Kubectl
* 3-workloads \
  Deployment via Helm Charts and Kubectl of payload workloads.  Two
  sample applications are deployed, `helloworld` and `MERN demo`.
* scripts \
  Utility scripts.

# Pre-requisistes

To deploy this project you need a [T Cloud Public](https://public.t-cloud.com/en)
tenant.  Normally I would create a specific project to host this tenant.
This project assumes private communication to clients systems via
a VPN.  The code here will create a VPC and wire up the VPN, but the
peer VPN gateway needs to exist already.

Also, make sure that you visit the Web Console page for Cloud
Container Engine (CCE), so that the agencies needed to deploy
Clusters are correctly set-up.

You will need the following credentials:

* Tenant administrator - to deploy the bulk of the code.  I would
  provide these credentials as environment variables. See
  [Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/opentelekomcloud/opentelekomcloud/latest/docs#authentication).
  I would recommend using AK/SK credentials.  Place them in an `env`
  file in `1-infra`:
  ```bash
  export OS_ACCESS_KEY=".... CHANGE ME ...."
  export OS_SECRET_KEY=".... CHANGE ME ...."
  export OS_PROJECT_NAME=".... CHANGE ME ...."

  ```
* User with DNS Admin rights - for the ACME DNS-01 handshake needed for
  issuing TLS certificates.  These need to be configure in a `tfvars`
  file.
  ```hcl
  acme_otc_creds = {
    OTC_USER_NAME    = ".... CHANGE ME ...."
    OTC_PASSWORD     = ".... CHANGE ME ...."
    OTC_DOMAIN_NAME  = "OTC000.... CHANGE ME ...."
    OTC_PROJECT_NAME = "eu-de_.... CHANGE ME ...."
  }
  ```
  Note the ACME `otc` provider only uspport username/password
  authentication.  The user specified here *ONLY* needs access
  to the DNS infrastructure of T Cloud Public.
* If using the remote backend for storing state, you need an account
  with Read/Write access to that bucket.  This is configured in
  `backend.hcl`.
  ```hcl
  #
  # Configure S3 backend
  #
  bucket                      = ".... CHANGE ME ...."
  key                         = "".... CHANGE ME ...."/terraform.tfstate"
  region                      = "eu-de"
  endpoint                    = "https://obs.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com"
  skip_credentials_validation = true
  skip_metadata_api_check     = true
  skip_region_validation      = true
  use_path_style              = true
  use_lockfile                = true
  ```
